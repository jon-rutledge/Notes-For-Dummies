## Anaconda/Conda ##

Anaconda is distribution software that allows us to create isolated 
development environments using very specific libraries and builds of Python.
This is very useful as some projects by be build specific.

Anaconda is the distribution service
Conda is the library that manages all the other libraries and will be used in Terminal
miniconda is a lighter weight version of Conda with less libraries

Conda is similar to PIP, but is NOT python specific.
Also it is more heavily focused on data science.

TIP:
You can export the exact list of lirbaries using Conda, so people know exactly
what your project uses.
