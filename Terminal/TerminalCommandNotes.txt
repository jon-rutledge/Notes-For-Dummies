## Anaconda/Conda ##

Anaconda is distribution software that allows us to create isolated 
development environments using very specific libraries and builds of Python.
This is very useful as some projects by be build specific.

Anaconda is the distribution service
Conda is the library that manages all the other libraries and will be used in Terminal
miniconda is a lighter weight version of Conda with less libraries

Conda is similar to PIP, but is NOT python specific.
Also it is more heavily focused on data science.

TIP:
You can export the exact list of lirbaries using Conda, so people know exactly
what your project uses.

------------------------------
Install and Managing packages
------------------------------

#list out all packages in Conda
conda list

#update all packages
conda upgrade --all

#Update single package
conda update package_name

#installing a package to conda 
conda install package_name

#example
conda install numpy

#install multiple packages at once
conda install numpy scipy pandas

#install specific version
conda install numpy=1.10

#remove packages from conda
conda remove package_name

#search through conda for installed package using wildcards
conda search '*beautifulsoup*'


------------------------------
Managing Development Environments
------------------------------

#create a new environment
conda create -n env_name list of packages

#-n env_name --> environment name == env_name
#list of packages can be any number, similar to the install command
#example:
conda create -n my_env numpy

#you can also specific the python version of the environment
conda create -n py3 python=3
conda create -n py2 python=2

#specific version to the point release:
conda create -n py python=3.3

#list environments
conda env list

#removing environments
conda env remove -n env_name

------------------------------
Activating and using a Conda environment
------------------------------


conda activate my_env

#when in a specific environment you will see a (env_name) on the left side of the terminal entry

#you can install individual items to the conda environment while it is active.
#think of it as a working directory for conda

#turn off/on
conda deactivate
conda activate


------------------------------
YAML exports and installing from a YAML
------------------------------

#you can export the packages currently in use in a conda environment with
conda env export

#this will tell you the packages in a list

#you can export to a YAML file with this
conda env export > environment.yaml

#create a new environment from yaml file as starting point
conda env create -f environment.yaml
