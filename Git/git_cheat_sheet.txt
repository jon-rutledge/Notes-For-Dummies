Cloning:
'''
This downloads a repo to the current working directory
'''

git clone URL_from_repo

Get Status:
'''
Will show what is different between your hosted cloned repo
and the original source repo
'''

git status


Adding:
'''
Will add a new file that is present in the working directory to
the repo so it will be included when committed

using * will add all new files
'''

git add filename
git add *  


Committing:
'''
will commit changes to be loaded to the repo when pushed

will not be synced to primary source until pushed
'''

git commit -m "Message about the commit"

NOTE:  if you forget to add a message, a weird window will come up
    you can get out of it with ESC --> :wq --> Enter


Pushing:
'''
sync the committed changes to the repo
'''

git push


Pull:
'''
if you have a branch of the repo, this will pull the existing 
version down to your directory

Think of this like a refresh to the clone
'''

git pull

Typical workflow:
1. Confirm you a branch of the repo (clone)
2. If yes, always pull before during work to get up to date
3. do work
4. commit changes
5. push changes

git clone URL
git pull
git add -A
git commit -m "message"
git push
